      Runoff pollution that occurs in the streets washes up harmful substances from the streets into the wastewater systems, but instead they overflow it and end up going straight into bodies of water without going through filtration. As a result, it leads to another problem of sewage pollution. Here is a list of what you can do to contribute in prevention:
      </p>
    </div>
    <ol>
      <li class="Runoff">Keep waste out of gutters and storm drains.</li>
      <li class="Runoff">Use fertilizer and other chemicals carefully.</li>
      <li class="Runoff">Get rid of household chemicals properly. For example, not in storm sewers or drains.</li>
      <li class="Runoff">Clean up spilled chemical fluids. Do not hose them into the street.</li>
      <li class="Runoff">Plant ground cover.</li>
      <li class="Runoff">Convince local government officials to develop some kind of control over the sediment and erosion of construction. </li>
      <li class="Runoff">Have your septic system inspected and pumped, at a minimum every three to five years.</li>
      <li class="Runoff">Purchase low in phosphorus products to reduce the nutrients discharge bodies of water.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="Important">
      <p class="SolutionP">
      Agriculture is a contributor to nutrients pollution through the fertilizers and manure released from there. Rain washes those excess nutrients from the fertilizers and manure into nearby waters, or those excess nutrients leak into ground waters. Another environmentally harmful compound known as ammonia comes from the fertilized soil and livestock, and it is harmful to the aquatic life that it drains to. Some possible solutions to these agriculture contributors to nutrients pollution are:  
      </p>
    </div>
     <li class="Farm">Watershed efforts from people and organizations.</li>
     <li class="Farm">Nutrient management i.e. correctly and responsibly using fertilizer.</li>
     <li class="Farm">Planting cover crops to take up excess nitrogen.</li>
     <li class="Farm">Buffers as in more surrounding plants should be planted to slow down the nutrients from reaching the bodies of water.</li>
     <li class="Farm">Doing less tilling to decreases the soil erosion, compaction and runoff while also building organic matter in the soil.</li>
     <li class="Farm">Managing livestock waste stops the nitrogen and phosphorus of it from reaching bodies of water.</li>
     <li class="Farm">Drainage water management decreases the influx of nutrients that drain into the bodies of water.</li>

      Oil is a natural resource commonly used as fuel, but can be dangerous if spilled in any bodies of water. Oil then spreads to other bodies of water or land. It can be harmful to marine life and animals who comes in contact with it. Ways to clean up or to prevent oil from spreading are:
      </p>
    </div>
    <ol>
      <li class="Oil">Physical barriers knowns as booms are placed in the water to slow down and contain the oil.</li>
      <li class="Oil">Boats known as skimmers remove oil from the surface of the water by using collection booms.</li>
      <li class="Oil">Responders would gather the oil with fire-proof booms before they light it on fire to get rid of it.</li>
      <li class="Oil">Dispersants would be used to make less of the oil stay on the surface.</li>
    </ol>
